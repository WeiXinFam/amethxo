# Group 56: Angry Birds Trajectory Tracking

This program feeds a video trailer of the 2009 Rovio Entertainment game 'Angry Birds' as input and displays this video in near-real-time as an output, annotated with colour-coded bounding boxes around the birds and pigs, as well as an estimate of birds' trajectories while in flight.
