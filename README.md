# Amethxo
This program is aimed to keep track of daily tasks and run algorithms to extract key activities. These information is then comppiled into an infographic for users' visualisation purposes. It can also be converted to pdf or word to lists skills to be written in resume or other purpose. On top of that, there is also a note taking service which finds keywords and ground them into a topic for better revision in the future.


Features
* Note taking for every semester's subject
* Learning Journey to be converted to resume
* Timing tasks and schedule on calendar

Goals
* Target for all ages
* Cloud based

Now
* Aimed at students
* Creating a web interface first

You may be required to install Add-On packages in MATLAB. To find out which Add-On packages have been installed or to install new packages, please follow the instructions in the next section - Installing. 

MATLAB Add-On packages required (versions listed are tested):
* Computer Vision System Toolbox (version 8.2)
* Image Processing Toolbox (version 10.3)

### Installing
Installation Guides for the MATLAB software can be found [here](https://au.mathworks.com/help/install/index.html?s_tid=srctitle).

To check existing/install new MATLAB Add-On packages:
```
1. Launch MATLAB by double clicking on the application.
2. Navigate to HOME tab > Add-Ons > Manage Add-Ons
3. If the packages you require are not listed, click on "Get Add-Ons" near the top right of the window.
